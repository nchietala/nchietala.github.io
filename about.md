My name is Nickholas Hietala, no that's not a typo.

My passion is for all things software and hardware. I have developed software for myself and for clients (often friends and family) using a variety of technologies including visual studio, windows forms, computer vision, and various languages. I often also work on the hardware side of a problem, mostly just soldering things, and then almost exclusively 12v wires to various things.

I am always learning and improving on my skills.
